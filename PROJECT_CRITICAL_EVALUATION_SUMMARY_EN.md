## 🚨 Critical Issues

### P0 - Must Fix (Blocking Release) 🔴

#### 1. Test Failure - Memory Safety Issue

**Problem**: `test_memory_pool` - Stack buffer overrun

**Root Cause**:

```rust
// Dangerous code
std::mem::replace(&mut self.inner, unsafe { std::mem::zeroed() })
```

**Solution**:

```rust
// Safe approach
std::mem::take(&mut self.inner)  // Requires T: Default
```

**Priority**: 🔴 P0  
**Effort**: 4 hours

---

#### 2. Error Handling - 247 unwrap() calls

**Risk**: Production panic risk

**Solution**:

```rust
// ❌ Current
let config = load_config().unwrap();

// ✅ Improved
let config = load_config()
    .context("Failed to load configuration")?;
```

**Priority**: 🔴 P0  
**Effort**: 7 days

---

#### 3. Missing Performance Benchmarks

**Problem**: Claims high performance but no data

**Solution**:

```bash
cargo bench --all > benchmark_results.txt
cargo install critcmp
critcmp main
```

**Priority**: 🔴 P0  
**Effort**: 3 days

---

### P1 - Should Fix 🟡

#### 4. Documentation Redundancy

**Issue**: 500+ markdown files, 60-70% duplication

**Solution**: Consolidate to structured documentation:

```text
docs/
├── getting-started/
├── user-guide/
├── architecture/
├── research/
└── development/
```

**Priority**: 🟡 P1  
**Effort**: 5 days

---

#### 5. Dependency Optimization

**Current**: 160 dependencies → **Target**: 40 (default)

**Strategy**: Feature flags

```toml
[features]
default = ["grpc", "http"]
full = ["default", "monitoring", "resilience"]
research = ["performance-research"]
```

**Priority**: 🟡 P1  
**Effort**: 3 days

---

#### 6. CI/CD Pipeline Missing

**Solution**: Implement GitHub Actions

- Automated testing
- Code coverage
- Security audit
- Performance regression detection

**Priority**: 🟡 P1  
**Effort**: 2 days
